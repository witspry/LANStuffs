        <br />
        <strong>Introduction : </strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        The application LanStuffs is all about connecting two or more individual LanStuffs
        applications located in different computers connected via LAN (Local Area Network).
        This application uses WinSock (Windows Socket) to connect and communicate between
        these two different applications and provide an illusion or virtualization of pure
        peer-to-peer networking communication which is generally not possible using WinSocks.<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>To connect and communicate between these two applications, please follow the
            below steps:</strong><br />
        <br />
        1) Run LanStuffs application on different computers (connected through LAN) on which
        you want to communicate.<br />
        <br />
        2) Click on the 'Connect' button. This will create a application server on default
        port number '1234' which actually receive the incoming request and will provide
        to the application for processing.<br />
        <br />
        3) After doing the second step with all the applications, goto :- Tools -&gt; Options
        -&gt; Manage Connections. In this window you can add connections to other applications
        running on different computers. You just have to provide the IP Addresses ( Internet
        Protocol Adress e.g. "192.167.23.87") of other computer connected through LAN.<br />
        <br />
        4) You have to do the above steps with all the applications that you want to communicate.<br />
        <br />
        5) Now, the connection setup is finished.<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>User Interfaces and their usages:</strong><br />
        <br />
        Coming back to the main window :
        <br />
        <br />
        <img src="Images/Main.JPG" alt="Main Window" /><br />
        <br />
        I have three computers connected via LAN and three LANStuffs applcations are running
        on these computers. I am running the application on computer having IP Address -
        "192.167.23.87". In this I have made two connections named "Ashish Jugran 1" and
        "Ashish Jugran 2" for the other two computers to communicate. I did the similar
        tasks with other applications also.<br />
        <br />
        Now, we can see a textbox right to the 'Send' button. In this I can type some text
        and when I finish typing, I can send this text to other computers. This text will
        be displayed in the "Broadcast Message" textbox of all other applications. I this
        way I can broadcast my messages to all the computers that are on the list of "Broadcast
        Connections List".<br />
        <br />
        I the similar way, I can send a file from my computer to all other connected computer
        without sharing the drives and folders.
        <br />
        <br />
        **** <strong>Now, You are absolutely knowing the power of LANStuffs</strong> ****<br />
        <br />
        *One of the most vital featue of this product is its Security. All the text messages
        and files that are sent through this application are completely secure as it uses
        a 256 bit key strong encryption supported by one of the most secure algorithm that
        we know - "<span style="text-decoration: underline">Triple Data Encryption Standard</span>
        (3 DES) ". Remember - the whole data is encrypted
        before sending.<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Now, moving further for more interesting features:<br />
        <br />
        When we send a message or file, in a way as above described, then it will be received
        by all the computer that are in the connection list. If we want to send the message
        or file to a paticular computer in the connection list then we can do this by -
        double clicking on the desired name on the connection list.<br />
        &nbsp;At this time a new window will open as shown below:<br />
        <br />
        <img src="Images/pcw.jpg" alt="Private Communication Window" /><br />
        <br />
        In this window we can send messages only to the computer that we wish to communicate
        privately without knowing to other compuers.<br />
        <br />
        I have also added a game named - "TicToe" that can be played between two players
        on different computer. The UI of the game is shown below:<br />
        <br />
        <img src="Images/tictoe.jpg" alt="TicToe"/><br />
        <br />
        In the game the player who proceed first will start the game first. All we have
        to do is first set the "number of matches" to be played, click on any one of the
        nine boxes and click on 'Done' button to give next chance to the other player. The
        other player will not set the "number of matchs" as it is already set by first player.
        Each match win will cause a gain of two points and a lose will cause a loss of one
        point. Remember - You can win the match by placing three ''cross" or three "circle"
        continuously in a row, column, or diagonal.<br />
        <br />
        ***New features and games (2 players or multiplayer) will be added in the upcoming
        versions of this product. Till then - Enjoy the LANStuffs...<br />
